# Romantic Web Sample

This project is a small app, which demonstrates the use of [Romantic Web](http://romanticweb.net), the RDF mapper for .NET.

What you will read below is actual source code from the [Program.cs](http://github.com/makolab/romanticweb.sample/Program.cs) file.

First, let's create some model interfaces and mappings. First we'll define a person entity, mapped with [FoaF][foaf] terms.

and some associated 
publications, which will be modelled with [Dublin Core][dc].
